## 🔄 CI/CD Workflow

This template includes a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline that runs on every push and pull request:

### Continuous Integration (CI)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Push/PR] --> B[Checkout Code]
    B --> C[Install Dependencies]
    C --> D[Type Check]
    C --> E[Lint]
    C --> F[Run Tests]
    C --> G[Build]
    D --> H{All Pass?}
    E --> H
    F --> H
    G --> H
    H -->|Yes| I[Deploy]
    H -->|No| J[Fail Build]
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Installs dependencies
- ✅ Runs all unit and integration tests
- ✅ Generates code coverage reports
- ✅ Builds production bundle

### Continuous Deployment (CD) *(Planned)*

**Deployment Options:**

1. **GitHub Pages** - Free hosting for static sites
2. **Vercel** - Zero-config deployments with preview URLs
3. **Netlify** - Continuous deployment with form handling
4. **AWS S3 + CloudFront** - Scalable cloud hosting
5. **Azure Static Web Apps** - Enterprise-grade hosting
6. **Cloudflare Pages** - Fast global CDN

## 🌳 Trunk-Based Development

This template follows **trunk-based development** practices, where developers collaborate on a single branch (trunk/main) with short-lived feature branches.

### Why Trunk-Based Development?

**Benefits:**
- 🚀 **Faster Integration** - Changes merge quickly, reducing integration conflicts
- 🔄 **Continuous Feedback** - Issues surface early through automated testing
- 📦 **Smaller Changes** - Encourages incremental, reviewable commits
- 🎯 **Simplified Workflow** - No complex branching strategies or long-lived branches
- 🤝 **Better Collaboration** - Team stays aligned on a single codebase state
- 🐛 **Easier Debugging** - Less time tracking down when bugs were introduced

### How It Works

1. **Short-lived branches** - Feature branches live for hours or days, not weeks
2. **Frequent commits** - Merge to main multiple times per day
3. **Always deployable** - Main branch is always in a releasable state
4. **CI/CD safety net** - Automated tests catch issues before merge
5. **Feature flags** - Deploy incomplete features hidden behind flags

### Common Misconceptions

❌ **"You need perfect code before merging"**  
✅ Code should be tested and working, but doesn't need to be perfect. Iterate in production.

❌ **"It's too risky without long-lived branches"**  
✅ Comprehensive CI/CD and automated testing make it safer than infrequent large merges.

❌ **"You can't work on big features"**  
✅ Use feature flags to deploy incrementally while keeping features hidden until ready.

❌ **"Code review quality suffers"**  
✅ Smaller, frequent changes are actually easier to review thoroughly.

❌ **"You need a huge team"**  
✅ Works for teams of any size - even solo developers benefit from the discipline.

### Best Practices

```bash
# 1. Pull latest changes frequently
git pull origin main

# 2. Create short-lived feature branch
git checkout -b quick-fix-button

# 3. Make small, focused changes
# ... make changes ...

# 4. Run tests locally
npm test

# 5. Merge quickly (same day if possible)
git push origin quick-fix-button
# Create PR, get review, merge to main
```

**Key principles:**
- Merge to main at least once per day
- Keep feature branches under 24 hours when possible
- Use feature flags for work-in-progress features
- Trust your CI/CD pipeline
- Fix broken builds immediately

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```bash
npm run test
```
Test individual components and functions in isolation.

### Integration Tests
```bash
npm run test:integration
```
Test how components work together.

### E2E Tests *(Planned with Playwright)*
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```
Test complete user workflows in a real browser.

### Coverage Reports
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```
View detailed coverage metrics in the terminal or `coverage/` directory.

## 🔐 Security

Security best practices:
- **Dependency Updates** - Keep dependencies up to date
- **HTTPS Everywhere** - Secure connections in production
- **Environment Variables** - Secure handling of sensitive data

## 📦 Deployment

### Manual Deployment

Build and deploy manually:

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# The built files will be in the dist/ folder
# Upload to your hosting provider
```

### Automated Deployment *(Coming Soon)*

Automatic deployments will be configured for:
- Merges to `main` → Production
- Merges to `develop` → Staging
- Pull Requests → Preview URLs

## 🎨 Customization

### Configuring CI/CD

Edit `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to customize:
- Node.js version
- Test commands
- Build scripts
- Deployment targets

## 📊 Code Quality

This template maintains code quality through:

- **Automated Testing** - Comprehensive test suite runs on every commit
- **Code Coverage** - Track test coverage metrics
- **Type Safety** - TypeScript catches errors at compile time
- **CI/CD Checks** - All tests must pass before merging
